# Docs directory: organize and keep it so

When the project has a `docs/` directory:

1. **Organize it**
   - Use a clear structure (e.g. by topic, user journey, or type: guides, reference, architecture).
   - Prefer a flat or shallow hierarchy; avoid deep nesting unless necessary.
   - Use consistent naming: lowercase, hyphens for multi-word files (e.g. `getting-started.md`, `api-reference.md`).
   - Add a top-level `README.md` or `index.md` that explains the structure and links to main sections.

2. **Keep it organized**
   - When adding new docs, place them in the right section and follow the existing naming and structure.
   - When changing or removing docs, update indexes and links so nothing is broken or orphaned.
   - Prefer updating existing docs over creating overlapping new ones; consolidate when it makes sense.

Apply this rule whenever creating, editing, or refactoring content under `docs/`.
