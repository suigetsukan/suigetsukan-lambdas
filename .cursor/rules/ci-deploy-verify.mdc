# CI Deploy Verification

Compiled from C2DS-brood, C2DS-bootstrap, GGG-esp32c3-controller, c2ds_mobile_provisioning_app AGENTS.md.

## Mandatory Rule

**All changes must be built and validated locally before committing.**

- Development proceeds by building locally, fixing issues, and rebuilding until the local build succeeds.
- Only then may changes be committed and pushed.
- GitHub CI is used strictly to **verify** a locally successful build, not as an iteration tool.

## Deploy Workflow

For repos that have a CI process: verify locally (build, tests) before commit. When changes are complete and
local verification passes, commit, push, and deploy. Verify the deploy worked. If not, fix issues and redeploy.
Iterate the fix-redeploy loop until successful.

## If CI Fails

1. Diagnose the failure
2. Fix locally
3. Rebuild to success
4. Recommit and push
5. Repeat until a green CI run is achieved

**A green CI run is required for work to be considered complete.**
